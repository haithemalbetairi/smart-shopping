# Smart Shopping System
A graduate level project.

This project is made in the interest of developing a better way to handle our daily/weekly shopping experiences. With how little time we have nowadays, the main goal is to help expedite the shopping experience for both customers and store management.
The main components that we hope to develop are:
- A smart shopping assistant, traditionally known as, the shopping cart.
- A smart shelving and inventory management mechanism.
- An easier way to self check-out.
